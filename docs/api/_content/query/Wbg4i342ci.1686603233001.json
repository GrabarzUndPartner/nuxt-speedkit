The iFrame is initialized only after a positive detection. This prevents immense data from having to be loaded when simply scrolling through the page.\nSo that no empty space is visible to the user, we use the functionality of the SpeedkitPicture and preload the corresponding Vimeo poster in different renditions, so the illusion is perfect for the user and he does not notice anything of the optimized lazy load procedure.","_type":"markdown","_id":"content:11.v3:3.guide:6.components:speedkit-vimeo.md","_source":"content","_file":"11.v3/3.guide/6.components/speedkit-vimeo.md","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/v3/guide/components/weak-hardware-overlay","_dir":"components","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","_empty":false,"title":"WeakHardwareOverlay","description":"The WeakHardwareOverlay is used in components that are affected by the SpeedkitLayer event Weak Hardware.
