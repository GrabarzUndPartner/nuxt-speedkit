The iFrame is initialized only after a positive detection. This prevents immense data from having to be loaded when simply scrolling through the page.\nSo that no empty space is visible to the user, we use the functionality of the SpeedkitPicture and preload the corresponding Youtube poster in different renditions, so the illusion is perfect for the user and he does not notice anything of the optimized lazy load procedure.","_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.guide:5.components:speedkit-youtube.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.guide/5.components/speedkit-youtube.md","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/migration/v3","_dir":"migration","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","_empty":false,"title":"Migrate from v2 to v3","description":"With v3 the documentation was changed.
