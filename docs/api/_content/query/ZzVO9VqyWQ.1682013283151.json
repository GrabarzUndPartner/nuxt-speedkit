However, we have created a separate Vue component for it, because at the time of the implementation of the module the component NuxtPicture and the API for generating the images were not yet completely finished, or this module did not yet completely cover our use-case. We hope that with the final completion of @nuxt/image we will be able to remove our component SpeedkitPicture and can use @nuxt/image & NuxtPicture with full functionality.","_type":"markdown","_id":"content:10.v1:guide:5.components:experimental-speedkit-picture.md","_source":"content","_file":"10.v1/guide/5.components/experimental-speedkit-picture.md","_extension":"md"}]
