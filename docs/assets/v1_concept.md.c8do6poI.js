Javascript) or to have only the static content (<code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>, <code>images</code> and <code>fonts</code>) displayed. Through this loading behaviour, a correspondingly high performance score can be achieved even with a low bandwidth, as specified by the lighthouse test, for example. For the user, on the other hand, it becomes transparent why there may be delays in the display of complex components or static resources in the further course of the website visit.</p><p>For this reason, this module can only be used with NuxtJS, as this requires static HTML in order to continue to display the full content to the user despite uninitialised Javascript.</p>',10);function p(t,u,m,f,_,g){return i(),a("div",null,[e("h1",d,[s(n(t.$frontmatter.title)+" ",1),l]),h])}const v=o(c,[["render",p]]);export{b as __pageData,v as default};
